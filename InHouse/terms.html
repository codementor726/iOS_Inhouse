If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says:&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>21.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WAIVER.</strong></p>
<p>The failure of INHOUSE to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by INHOUSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>21.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</strong></p>
<p>If a dispute arises between you and INHOUSE, the goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective method of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and INHOUSE agree that any dispute, claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of these Terms, the Sites, the Applications, the INHOUSE Network or the other INHOUSE Services (a &ldquo;<strong>Dispute</strong>&rdquo;) will be resolved in accordance with this Section 21.3 or as INHOUSE and you otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these dispute methods, INHOUSE strongly encourages you to first contact INHOUSE directly to seek a resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(a) Choice of Law.</strong>&nbsp;These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, PROCEEDING, CAUSE OF ACTION OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY DISPUTE OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR ANY OF THE INHOUSE SERVICES.</p>

YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND INHOUSE (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR ANY OF THE INHOUSE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION YOUR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION'S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND INHOUSE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. YOUR ARBITRATION FEES AND YOUR SHARE OF ARBITRATOR COMPENSATION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY SUCH RULES. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND INHOUSE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. YOU MAY BRING DISPUTES ONLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF.</p>
<p>Neither you nor INHOUSE will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any disputes covered by these Terms TO ARBITRATE. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST INHOUSE INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if INHOUSE is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>Any arbitration shall take place in New York County, New York and the number of arbitrators shall be one (1). Except as otherwise required by law, the parties and the arbitrator agree to keep confidential and not disclose to third parties any information or documents obtained in connection with the arbitration process, including the resolution of the Dispute.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms.</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judicial Forum for Disputes. In the event that the agreement to arbitrate under Section 21.3(b) is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and INHOUSE agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) must be brought solely and exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and other applicable procedural rules of, the federal or state courts covering New York County, NY. Both you and INHOUSE irrevocably consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. Notwithstanding the foregoing, INHOUSE may bring a claim for equitable relief in any court with proper jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your membership, your use of any of the INHOUSE Services or your relationship with INHOUSE.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;<strong>30 Day Right to Opt Out</strong>. Members have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in this Section 21.3 above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the INHOUSE contact information listed at the bottom of these Terms. The notice must be sent to INHOUSE within thirty (30) days of the commencement of your membership or agreeing to these Terms, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of this Section 21.3. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, however, we also will not be bound by them.</p>
<p>(d)<strong>&nbsp;Improperly Filed Claims.</strong>&nbsp;All claims you bring against INHOUSE must be resolved in accordance with this Section 21.3. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section 21.3 shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section 21.3, INHOUSE may recover attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs up to $15,000, provided that INHOUSE has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;<strong>Prevailing Party</strong>.&nbsp; In the event that either party institutes any legal suit, action or proceeding against the other party arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Privacy Policy, or any of the INHOUSE Services, the prevailing party in the suit, action or proceeding shall be entitled to receive in addition to all other damages to which it may be entitled, the costs incurred by such party in conducting the suit, action or proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and court costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(f)<strong>&nbsp; Limitation on Time to File Claims.&nbsp;</strong>ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR DISPUTE YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE PRIVACY POLICY, ANY OF THE INHOUSE SERVICES, ANY PRODUCT OR OTHER SERVICES, ANY CONTENT OR YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH INHOUSE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR DISPUTE IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>21.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SEVERABILITY.</strong></p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms (including any Policies) is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>21.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASSIGNMENT.</strong></p>
<p>These Terms and related Policies, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by INHOUSE without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms shall be void.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>21.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SURVIVAL.</strong></p>
<p>Upon termination of these Terms, your use of the Sites, the Applications, the INHOUSE Network or any of the other INHOUSE Services or your relationship with INHOUSE, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 1, 2, and 6 - 21.</p>
